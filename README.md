# Interactive Survival Tables

This repo houses the code for my entry into the [R-Studio Table competition.](https://community.rstudio.com/tag/table-contest)

It is built with `reactable`, `DT`, `highcharter`, `survminer` and is hosted as a `shiny` application. The data set used for the demonstration comes from the `KMsurv` package.
